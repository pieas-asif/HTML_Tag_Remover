<p><strong>Question 36: </strong>Language appears to be ________ to use. However, its sophistication is often overlooked<strong><em>.    </em></strong></p>
<p>Keywords for this question: <strong><em>appears, sophistication, overlooked</em></strong></p>
<p>This answer is found in paragraph D. Here, in lines 5-9, the author says, “.. . ..
